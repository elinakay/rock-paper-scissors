Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

- Rock destroys scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.
- If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

The code breaks the game into four parts:

- Get the user’s choice.
- Get the computer’s choice.
- Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
- Start the program and display the results.

Secret cheat code: if a user types 'bomb' as their choice, they win, no matter what.
